## üß≠ Historical Context Summary

In the early 700s, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Britain were undergoing rapid Christianization. Eangyth, an abbess and noblewoman in Kent, was among a rare class of women with religious, political, and intellectual influence. Boniface ‚Äî later called the ‚ÄúApostle to the Germans‚Äù ‚Äî was an Anglo-Saxon monk who launched missionary campaigns into what is now Germany.

This letter ‚Äî sent across the Channel from a woman cloistered in Thanet to a man in the forests of Hesse ‚Äî is a testament to early medieval female agency in transnational Christianity. She critiques power structures and gives strategic advice ‚Äî rare in female correspondence from this period.

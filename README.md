# Monumental Letters: A Documentary Podcast Series

**"Monumental Letters: Lesser-Known Correspondence Between Women That Changed Europe"** is a 20-episode historical podcast and multimedia project that explores socially transformative letters exchanged between women (or from women to others) across 2000 years of European history. Each episode presents a dramatized and contextualized reading of one such letter, followed by in-depth historical narration and analysis. The project includes translated readings, original-language excerpts, geographic maps, visualized artifacts, and immersive soundscapes rooted in the time period of each letter.

## 📚 Episode Criteria

All letters included meet the following criteria:

- **Historical Impact:** Each letter measurably influenced social, political, intellectual, or spiritual life in its time or shortly thereafter.
- **Relative Obscurity:** The letters are academically recognized but are not widely known in popular media or mainstream culture.
- **Documented Authenticity:** Surviving in manuscript, microform, or scholarly transcription, with traceable archival references.
- **Geographic Breadth:** Letters span the full extent of “Europe” as it was defined in its era, with at least one party in the exchange having European cultural or political ties.
- **Chronological Range:**  
  - 20 total letters  
  - 3–5 from before the rise of Islam (~7th c. CE)  
  - 3 before 1000 AD  
  - 3 before 1500 AD  
  - 6–7 from the last 500 years  
  - 5 from the last 100 years
